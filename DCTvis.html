				<strong>How to Use</strong><br>
				The two panels (DCT Matrix and Image views) above represent 8x8 matrices. The one on the left is a DCT matrix with values running from -1024 to 1023, while the one on the right represents the image, with values running from 0 to 255. You can change the value of any square by hovering your cursor over the square and doing any of the following:
				
				<ul>
					<li>Scroll your mouse wheel</li>
					<li>Left click to max out value</li>
					<li>Right click to bring value to minimum</li>
					<li>Middle click to "center" value</li>
				</ul>

			You can also click the full image on the left Pixel Picker panel, which will update the Image View with the pixels selected.
